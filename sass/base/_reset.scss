/* Used to simplify the sizing process 
    of a couple of elements inside a box :
    
    Each element will be automatically resized
    to fit into the box (here, the box's total 
    size includes automatically every margin, 
    border, and padding of all of its elements).
    
    If those elements are too wide for 
    the size of the box, they will 
    squeeze up to each other
    (the size of the box itself will remain the same).
    
    The star (*) selects all the elements 
    (in this case, before AND after the css properties 
   are declared) */
